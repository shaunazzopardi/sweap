# Replication Instructions

Data for Table 1 is generated by running each of the `run-<tool>.sh` scripts.
Each script generates a file `out-<tool>-<timestamp>` file containing results
and runtimes for each benchmark. Some scripts also generate a `log-...` file
to justify why we consider some experiments to result in an error.
The program `gen_csv.py` automatically retrieves data from all `out-` files in
the directory and formats them into a CSV.
Runtimes are in ms, with the following caveats:

* A value of 1 denotes a missing data point.
* A value of 2 denotes an error from the tool.
* Negative values denote an incorrect verdict (e.g., a value of -1000 means
  that the tool ran for 1 s and returned a "realizable" verdict for an
  unrealizable problem, or vice versa).
* All values greater than 600000 (i.e., 10 minutes) denote a timeout.

The log files used to compile the submitted tables (and the resulting CSV)
are available in the `scripts/submitted` directory. To test `gen_csv.py`
without running all the experiments, just copy these files into `scripts`.
